# **Terminal and Git CheatSheet**

### ***Commands used in Terminal***

        - pwd = where one is (your directory - i.e.: /users/rimmderes)
        - ls = list content in current directory
        - ls -a = lists content including hidden files
        - ls -l = more details to content
        - ls -al = further detail
        - cd = used to move to different directory (cd path/to/location)
            example = cd Documents = change directory to Documents
            & Documents cd Zoom - moves from Documents folder to Zoom
            (cd alone takes you back to the home directory)
        - cd .. = move up one directory
        - cd - = return to folder when you have accidently gone off it
